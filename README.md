# DataScience_Covid19_analysis
My first very basic data science project. Dataset shows the data regarding covid-19 in Indian states.

You can conclude some important factors like:
1. In cell no. 10, you can clearly see that the most 3 affected states of India are Maharashtra, Kerala and Karnataka respectively.
2. in cell no. 8 Fig.1, it can be seen that the number of total cases and number of patients being discharged has a linear relationship.
3. We can also see that as the no of cases were incresed, there was a sudden rise in the rate of deaths.
